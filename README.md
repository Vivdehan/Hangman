# Hangman
Hangman Game
Overview
This Python program is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game Hangman. Players try to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters. The game features a visual representation of the hangman, and players have a limited number of lives to guess the correct word.

Features
1. Random Word Selection
The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list for players to guess.

2. Visual Representation
The game includes a visual representation of the hangman's progress as players make incorrect guesses.

3. User Interaction
Players can guess letters by inputting them, and the program provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word.

4. Game Logic
The program tracks the player's progress, deducts lives for incorrect guesses, and determines the outcome of the game (win or lose).

5. Word Display
A visual representation of the word is displayed, with underscores representing unguessed letters.

How to Play
Run the program.
The program selects a random word, and the player begins with a certain number of lives.
Input a letter to guess. The program will reveal the positions of the correctly guessed letters.
Incorrect guesses will decrement the player's lives and progress the hangman visual.
The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.
